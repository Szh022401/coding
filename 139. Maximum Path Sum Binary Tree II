Hard
Given a binary tree in which each node contains an integer number. Find the maximum possible sum from any node to any node (the start node and the end node can be the same). 

Assumptions

â€‹The root of the given binary tree is not null
Examples

   -1

  /    \

2      11

     /    \

    6    -14
